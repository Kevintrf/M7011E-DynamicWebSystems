--Prosumer-- BASIC FUNCTIONALITY DONE
-Create generic good looking errormessage box
	Implement errorbox/successbox on all frontend pages
-Upload picture in houseSetup
	-Show picture somewhere on dashboard
-Add updateHouse page
-Add check in dashboard for if prosumer exists

--Manager--
-Setup screen for creating initial powerplant like houseSetup
-Screen to change values (almost like houseSetup)
-When producing, control ratio sent to buffer/market (when stopped buffer supplies market demand)
-See who is logged in

--API
*Look for isNotManager in users and not prosumers (where applicable, for example pages you can reach and use before creating your powerplant)

--Simulator--
Everything should be done, doublecheck later!

--Frontend
-Redirect from prosumer/manager page to other page if ex. manager is on prosumer site
-Switch all api calls from "localhost" to file directory so it works online
-Test the application online, watch for CORS errors
-Fix sidebuttons to lead to correct links (done on prosumer side)
-After deleting/changing username on a user in editUsers the select list needs to be cleared before it is updated
-Weird error comes up after blocking user in chrome dev tools, it still works tho
